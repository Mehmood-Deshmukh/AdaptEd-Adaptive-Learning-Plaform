Computer got such important in our world not because they can do Mathematical operations quickly, but due to the fact that we can automate many things which previously needed human intervention. A computer can now not only predict stock market prices and process searches and news feed but can also detect human faces which is not a big thing for humans but it is pretty tricky for a computer to do.

But before deploying an ML model commercially, it is trained on relevant data. That data is purified before feeding to the model. After training the model, it is tested if it is giving correct predictions of human inputs. If it works as expected, then it will be deployed commercially.

        "content": "Executing a Java program using multiple threads is commonly known as multi-threading. This is generally done to improve the throughput and performance of your application, especially if are doing a lot of CPU-intensive tasks. Since CPU is a scarce resource but many programs leave CPU underused, by leveraging multiple threads you get an option to make full use of CPU and increase the throughput of your Java application. When Java first came into the scene, its ability to execute programs on multiple threads got the attention. The Java Programming language has built-in support in terms of synchronized and volatile keywords for executing programs in multiple threads. Though multithreading is not easy because when the same piece of code is executed by multiple threads, a lot of data and control-related issues happen like deadlock, livelock, race conditions, etc. It’s seriously difficult to get the concurrency right for the very first time, hence a Java developer should have a good understanding of different multi-threading and concurrency concepts before writing a multi-threaded and concurrent Java application. These are the skills you generally learn on the job but nowadays people expect you to know before you come for an interview and that’s where these Java courses and books can help you. They provide the much-needed foundation and real-world examples to build the thread fundamentals and other multithreading concepts and terminology."

Apart from the basics of multi-threading like threads, lock, synchronization, blocking, etc, you will learn about Concurrent Collections which can simplify some concurrency design patterns. For example, it’s very easy to implement the Producer-Consumer pattern using BlockingQueue class as compared to a normal Collection with the wait and notify as shown here.  This course discusses CountDowLatch, CyclicBarrier, Blocking Queue, Delay Queue, PriorityQueue, Exchanger, and concurrent maps like ConcurrentHashMap. Apart from Producer-Consumer, this course also explains the Dining Philosopher Problem and demonstrates two simulation projects i.e. Student Libary Simulation and Minor Game Simulation, which will allow you to apply the knowledge you learn."

If you have worked in a multi-threaded application before then you know that creating new threads at the time of request processing can slow you down and that’s why it’s better to use a pool of threads to process the request. Java solves this problem by introducing the Executor framework in JDK 1.5 which provides the infrastructure and API you need to create and manage a thread pool. Apart from the Executor Framework, you will also learn about some basics of threading like naming threads for debugging, terminating threads, handling the uncaught exception, scheduling tasks, etc."

Significance of Survey Parameters (Scale: 0–5, where 0 = low, 5 = high): visualLearning: Preference for visual aids (e.g., diagrams, videos). High values (4–5) indicate reliance on visuals; low (0–1) suggests minimal visual dependency. auditoryLearning: Preference for listening-based learning (e.g., podcasts). High = auditory-focused; low = less reliance on sound. readingWritingLearning: Preference for text-based learning (e.g., articles). High = thrives on reading/writing; low = avoids textual engagement. kinestheticLearning: Preference for hands-on activities (e.g., labs). High = learns by doing; low = prefers passive methods. challengeTolerance: Comfort with difficult tasks. High = resilient to challenges; low = avoids complexity. timeCommitment: Availability for learning. High = dedicated time investment; low = limited availability. learningPace: Speed of learning. High = fast-paced; low = prefers gradual progress. socialPreference: Preference for group work. High = collaborative; low = solitary. feedbackPreference: Desire for guidance.
